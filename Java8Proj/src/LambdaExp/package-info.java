package LambdaExp;

//Lambda expression is a new and important feature of Java which was included in Java SE 8. 
//It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method interface using an expression. 
//It is very useful in collection library.
//It helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection.


//Lambda expression provides implementation of functional interface. 
//An interface which has only one abstract method is called functional interface. 
//Java provides an anotation @FunctionalInterface, which is used to declare an interface as functional interface.


//Java lambda expression is consisted of three components.
//1) Argument-list: It can be empty or non-empty as well.
//2) Arrow-token: It is used to link arguments-list and body of expression.
//3) Body: It contains expressions and statements for lambda expression.
